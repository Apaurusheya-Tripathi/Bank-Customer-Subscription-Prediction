    "### Using Machine Learning to Predict Subscription to Bank Term Deposits for Clients with Scikit-Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "Marketing to potential clients has always been a crucial challenge in attaining success for banking institutions. Itâ€™s not a surprise that banks usually deploy mediums such as social media, customer service, digital media and strategic partnerships to reach out to customers. But how can banks market to a specific location, demographic, and society with increased accuracy? With the inception of machine learning - reaching out to specific groups of people have been revolutionized by using data and analytics to provide detailed strategies to inform banks which customers are more likely to subscribe to a financial product. In this project on bank marketing with machine learning, I will explain how a particular Portuguese bank can use predictive analytics from data science to help prioritize customers which would subscribe to a bank deposit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set is based off the direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. These marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. More than one contact to a client was required, in order to know if the product (bank term deposit) was subscribed by a client or not. The classification goal is to predict if a client will subscribe to the bank term deposit (yes/no).\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains 21 columns including the output (y). I am going to discard the output column and use the remaining columns to find the most relatable independent variables (x) that will be able to predict if a customer will subscribe to a bank deposit or not."

Yet, the duration is not known before a call is performed. Also, after the end of the call y is obviously known. Thus, this input should only be included for benchmark purposes and should be discarded if the intention is to have a realistic predictive model.\n",
