# Bank Customer Subscription Prediction

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h3>Using Machine Learning to Predict Subscription to Bank Term Deposits for Clients with Scikit-Learn</h3>

Marketing to potential clients has always been a crucial challenge in attaining success for banking institutions. Itâ€™s not a surprise that banks usually deploy mediums such as social media, customer service, digital media and strategic partnerships to reach out to customers. But how can banks market to a specific location, demographic, and society with increased accuracy? With the inception of machine learning - reaching out to specific groups of people have been revolutionized by using data and analytics to provide detailed strategies to inform banks which customers are more likely to subscribe to a financial product. In this project on bank marketing with machine learning, I will explain how a particular Portuguese bank can use predictive analytics from data science to help prioritize customers which would subscribe to a bank deposit.

The data set is based off the direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. These marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. More than one contact to a client was required, in order to know if the product (bank term deposit) was subscribed by a client or not. The classification goal is to predict if a client will subscribe to the bank term deposit (yes/no).

The dataset contains 21 columns including the output (y). I am going to discard the output column and use the remaining columns to find the most relatable independent variables (x) that will be able to predict if a customer will subscribe to a bank deposit or not.

<h2>Dataset</h2>
<h3>Input variables:</h3>

1 - age (numeric)

2 - job : type of job (categorical: 'admin.','blue-collar','entrepreneur','housemaid','management','retired','self-employed','services','student','technician','unemployed','unknown')

3 - marital : marital status (categorical: 'divorced','married','single','unknown'; note: 'divorced' means divorced or widowed)

4 - education (categorical: 'basic.4y','basic.6y','basic.9y','high.school','illiterate','professional.course','university.degree','unknown')

5 - default: has credit in default? (categorical: 'no','yes','unknown')

6 - housing: has housing loan? (categorical: 'no','yes','unknown')

7 - loan: has personal loan? (categorical: 'no','yes','unknown')

<h3>Related with the last contact of the current campaign:</h3>

8 - contact: contact communication type (categorical: 'cellular','telephone')

9 - month: last contact month of year (categorical: 'jan', 'feb', 'mar', ..., 'nov', 'dec')

10 - day_of_week: last contact day of the week (categorical: 'mon','tue','wed','thu','fri')

11 - duration: last contact duration, in seconds (numeric). Important note: this attribute highly affects the output target (e.g., if duration=0 then y='no'). Yet, the duration is not known before a call is performed. Also, after the end of the call y is obviously known. Thus, this input should only be included for benchmark purposes and should be discarded if the intention is to have a realistic predictive model.

<h3>Other attributes:</h3>

12 - campaign: number of contacts performed during this campaign and for this client (numeric, includes last contact)

13 - pdays: number of days that passed by after the client was last contacted from a previous campaign (numeric; 999 means client was not previously contacted)

14 - previous: number of contacts performed before this campaign and for this client (numeric)

15 - poutcome: outcome of the previous marketing campaign (categorical: 'failure','nonexistent','success')

<h3>Social and economic context attributes:</h3>

16 - emp.var.rate: employment variation rate - quarterly indicator (numeric)

17 - cons.price.idx: consumer price index - monthly indicator (numeric)

18 - cons.conf.idx: consumer confidence index - monthly indicator (numeric)

19 - euribor3m: euribor 3 month rate - daily indicator (numeric)

20 - nr.employed: number of employees - quarterly indicator (numeric)

<h3>Output variable (desired target):</h3>

21 - y - has the client subscribed a term deposit? (binary: 'yes','no')

Dataset has 40,000+ rows of data.

<h3>In this project I will demonstrate how to build a model predicting clients subscribing to a bank's term deposit in Python using the following steps:</h3>

-Data Cleaning

-EDA & Data Preprocessing

-Handling Imbalanced Data - SMOTE

-Model Training/Evaluation/Hyper Parameter Tuning

<h2>Project Definition</h2>
The classification goal is to predict if a client will subscribe to the bank term deposit (yes/no).
